# ![Duckgen](https://github.com/fairfield-programming/ducks/blob/master/.github/logo.png?raw=true)

## Download

Since the Fairfield Programming Association's duck generator is built on top of node.js and npm, you need to have both of those installed as prerequisites. After that, to download the project, you have to run the below command. From there, you can include it in your node.js code by using the import or require system.

```bash
npm install duckgen
```

## Features

We didn't want to use people's faces for the profile pictures. This was for three reasons: we didn't want to pay for hosting the image files, we were scared of what people would upload, and since our main audience is minors, we didn't want their faces to be publicly available. To solve these problems, we decided to use rubber duck avatars instead of photos. Users are able to customize their ducks by adding glasses, hats, items, etc (and they can even set their own colors).
